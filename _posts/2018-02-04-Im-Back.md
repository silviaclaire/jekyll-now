The thesis defense is finally over!!!😝
Two months left before my new job starts...But there are so many things I would like to learn!🤓

- [Advanced React and Redux - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/)

- [iOS 11 & Swift 4 - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/)

- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2018 - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

Also I'm quite interested in Udacity's new nanodegree program...but it is so pricy😖

- [Flying Cars and Autonomous Flight Nanodegree Program - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787)

Whatever, I'm going to make full use of my [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).😙
